# Algorithms and Data Structures Course Materials

## Course Overview

This repository contains materials related to the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course, which builds on the knowledge obtained from "Introduction to Programming". The course introduces basic data structures, algorithms, and computational complexity, covering search methods, recursion, sorting algorithms, dynamic data structures, hashing, binary trees, heaps, graph structures, and elementary string/text search algorithms.

## Lecturers

- Prof. Ivica Botički
- Assoc. Prof. Mirjana Domazet-Lošo
- Prof. Vedran Mornar
- Prof. Mile Šikić
- Associate Lecturer: Danijel Mlinarić, PhD

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand and describe various data structures and standard algorithms.
- Apply appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve specific problems.
- Develop programs utilizing these data structures and algorithms.
- Evaluate the complexity of algorithms and programs.
- Identify suitable data structures and algorithms for problem-solving.

## Course Structure

- **Lectures:** Held over 15 weeks in two cycles, with intermediate exams.
- **Independent Assignments:** Tasks assigned for individual study.
- **Laboratory:** Conducted in two to three cycles of exercises.
